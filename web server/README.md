Option 1: Webserver - python

My program listens for a connection from a browser and then serves the HTML file to said browser and stops listening.
The multithreaded server functions in the same way but it will continue to listen after the first connection has been made and will serve the page to multiple connections. 

Run the python server, no input is necessary. The web address used was http://localhost/hello.html
